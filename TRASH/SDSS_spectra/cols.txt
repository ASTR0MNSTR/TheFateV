sii_6731_reqw (float32): The equivalent width of the continuum-subtracted emission line computed from straight integration over the bandpasses listed below (emisison is negative). In this case the continuum comes from a running 200 pixel median and does not properly account for stellar absorption. In general the EQW measurements provide a better measure of the true equivalent width. The purpose of this measurement is to help characterize the stellar absorption effecting the line. (EW_stellar = REQW - EQW) (Å)
sii_6731_reqw_err (float32): Error in the equivalent width described above (Å)
sii_6731_eqw (float32): The equivalent width of the CB08 continuum-subtracted emission line computed from straight integration over the bandpasses listed below (emisison is negative) . This properly takes into account stellar absorption. Note that it will not be correct in the case of blended lines (i.e., NII & H-alpha) (Å)
sii_6731_eqw_err (float32): Error in the equivalent width described above (Å)
sii_6731_flux (float32): Flux from Gaussian fit to continuum subtracted data. (Note that the fit is done simultaneously to all the lines so de-blending happens automatically) (10-17 erg cm-2 s-1)

sii_6731_inst_res (float32): Instrumental resolution at the line center (measured for each spectrum from the ARC lamps) (km s-1)

spectofiber (float32): The multiplicative scale factor applied to the original flux and error spectra prior to measurement of the emission lines to improve the spectrophotometric accuracy. The rescaling insures that a synthetic r-band magnitude computed from the spectrum matches the r-band fiber magnitude measured by the photometric pipeline.
